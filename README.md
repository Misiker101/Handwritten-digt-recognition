## Dataset used
For this project I used the MNIST dataset. It is freely available on the Internet.

## Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Sklearn
3. OpenCV
4. numpy
5. Jupyter-Notebook

## Training CNN model


## Digit recognition using OpenCV
<b>untitled.ipynb</b> - This is a python notebook for recognising handwritten digit in images using OpenCV .This file is using trained CNN model.

## How to use these projects
You can use these projects direct opening the particular python notebook <b>untitled.ipynb</b>.
